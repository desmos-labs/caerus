In Greek mythology, Caerus /ˈsɪərəs, ˈsiːrəs/ (Greek: Καιρός, Kairos, the same as kairos) was the personification of

## What is Caerus?

Caerus is a set of tools that developers can use to build their own centralized server for easier application
development on top of Desmos. It consists of two main packages:

- The `server` package contains functions and type definitions useful for building a centralized server that can grant
  fee allowances, send notifications, and generate dynamic links for client applications.

- The `client` package contains utility functions that make it easy to interact with a Caerus server instance. This
  option is suitable for those who are building a centralized server and don't want to maintain their own Caerus
  instance. You can use the `client` package to interact with
  our [official Caerus server instance](#official-caerus-server).

## Official Caerus Server

If you prefer not to maintain your own Caerus server instance, you can use our official one. It's available at the
following address:
