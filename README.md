In Greek mythology, Caerus /ˈsɪərəs, ˈsiːrəs/ (Greek: Καιρός, Kairos, the same as kairos) was the personification of
opportunity, luck and favorable moments. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caerus))

## What is Caerus?

Caerus is a centralized server designed to gather various useful features for developers creating applications on
Desmos. These features include:

- Requesting fee grants for onboarding new users.
- Sending notifications to end clients.
- Uploading files to IPFS and creating associated placeholders using [BlurHash](https://blurha.sh/).
- Generating deep links supported by official applications (e.g., DPM).

The code in this repository serves two main purposes:

1. **Maintaining Your Own Caerus Instance:**
   If you want full control over the features available to your clients, you can build and run the binary or use the
   provided Dockerfile to maintain your Caerus instance.

2. **Using the Official Caerus Server:**
   If you prefer not to manage your Caerus instance, you can register as an application within
   the [official server](#official-caerus-server). Upon [registration](#registering-as-an-application), you'll receive
   an authentication token to make calls to the server. This approach is suitable if you're already developing a
   centralized server or an end-user client and want to leverage Caerus's features without reimplementation. To create
   your client implementation, you can utilize a [Protobuf Compiler](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/) and
   reference the files in the `proto` folder.

## Official Caerus Server

If you prefer not to maintain your own Caerus server instance, you can use our official one. It's available at the
following address:

```
https://caerus.desmos.network
```

### Registering as an application

If you want to use the official Caerus instance, your application needs to be registered on our server. To get started,
just reach out to our team at `development@desmos.network`. Let us know that you're interested in becoming a registered
developer. We'll handle the process of setting up an account for you and giving you an authorization token. This token
will allow you to make requests to our server seamlessly.

## Development

While developing Caerus we use some external tools and libraries to make our life easier.

### Tests

#### Mocks

Some tests require mocks to properly work in order to isolate the behavior from external factors.
To generate such mocks we use [gomock](https://github.com/uber-go/mock). After installing it, you can run the following
commands to generate the stubs:

```
mockgen -source routes/notifications/expected_interfaces.go -destination routes/notifications/testutils/expected_interfaces.mock.go -package testutils
```
